This is a WIP project for learning about graphics programming.

It is a basic implentation of a batched 2D renderer in Odin using [sokol-odin](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin).

If you'd like to run it, you'll need [sokol-shdc](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-tools) to compile the shader.

Then simply run `build.sh` to build the project into `build/main` or run `build.sh run` to build and run in one step.
